## Treehouse TAP ~ OOP PHP Game Show App


### About Project: Phrase Hunter
This project uses Object-Oriented Programming principles in PHP to create a word/phrase guessing game. The selection of phrases are random and remain hidden unitl the user selects individual letters via the onsreen keyboard or their device keyboard, to reveal the prhase, a letter at a time.

For each guess, the web app compares the player selection with the random phrase and if the letter is in the phrase, the chosen letters will be displayd on the screen. A letter can only be guessed once, at which time it will be disabled on the onscreen keyboard. The letter selection continues until the player guesses the correct phrase. If the phrase is guessed before running out of guessing attempts, a  winning screen will apear, otherwise, an alternative screen will appear if there are 5 incorrect guesses.
